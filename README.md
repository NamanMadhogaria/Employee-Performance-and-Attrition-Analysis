# Employee-Performance-and-Attrition-Analysis
This project leverages data warehousing, Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze workforce trends, identify key drivers of employee attrition, and assess performance metrics. The goal is to provide organizations with data-driven insights to optimize employee retention strategies and improve overall productivity.

Problem Statement

High employee attrition leads to increased hiring costs, loss of institutional knowledge, reduced productivity, and business disruptions. Many struggle to identify the root causes due to a lack of comprehensive data analysis.

 Objectives
Identify factors influencing employee attrition, such as salary, work-life balance, and tenure.
Help management reduce the attrition rate by uncovering the root causes.
Create interactive reports in Power BI for actionable insights.
Improve HR decision-making using data-driven insights
